- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tomazku, but my real name is Thomas.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot oh things, but I don't hide that between all these things the "coding world" is interesting me a lot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of beginner stuff, I start learning HTML & CSS less than 1 year ago and I continue to learn. I would like to understand javascript better, then also server languages and eventually learn a Javascript framework. For the moment I haven't decided which framework to go for, but I'm hesitating between Vue.js and React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate for now because I don't have project in progress, but I would like to learn and collaborate in near future
